# simple-blockchain-example
This is my project submission for module 1 of Udacity's Blockchain Developer Nanodegree course.

The boilerplate code for this project was provided by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com).

The original README.md that came with the boilerplate code can be found [here](./old-README.md).

The purpose of this project is to implement a simple blockchain solution that can store, sign, validate and retrieve data.
